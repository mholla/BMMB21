This code reproduces the results of Wang 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10237-020-01400-w)

User subroutines and input files are included to reproduce the simulations of folding, along with scripts for the analysis of thickness in simulations.  Additionally, data files and analysis scripts are presented for the comparison with human data.
